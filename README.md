Our application domain is political and sociological data. We explore unemployment trends, crime trends, income inequality trends while also looking at approval ratings for recent presidents. We also make a brief foray into exploring data on election results in House, Senate, and Presidential races.

Our limitations include a basic User Interface in the sense that the possible queries we allow are all listed on the html page. We don’t allow for a user to enter a query (ie: no NLI). Incorporating a NLI would be a possible next step if we had more time. In addition, our visualizations are not as complex/sophisticated as we’d like. If we had more time, we’d have liked to work on making them more interesting. One such example is being able to plot the unemployment trend line over the past 50-60 years but having a color-coded segment of the line correspond to the president at the time with a legend somewhere on the graph. Another example could be clustering more specific election data (county election data) to provide data visualization that shows groups of people who voted for a certain party.
